## Introduction
Dot books are small notebooks used by marching bands to help players learn formations on a field.
Each page displays a condensed version of the entire formation, limited to the area around a specific performer.
For more information, check out the Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_book).

Many times, the software used by the designer of the show only provides performers with a non-visual summary of their positions:

and band directors with a cursory overview of the formation:

As performers, it is very difficult to learn movements without a portable and detailed visual guide.
Thus, our band director required us to draw own dot books, which was incredibly time-consuming since each of our shows has around 60 different sets/formations.
In addition, the sheer amount of data that needed to be copied over to each dot book resulted in quite a few data entry errors.

This app automatically generates each performer's dot book as a PDF file, which can then be printed out.
Over half of my 120-member band opted to use these generated dot books during the 2018 season.
Since each dot book takes around 5 hours to make manually, this collectively saved over 300 hours of time.

## How to use
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/irwin-deng/Dotbook-Generator/releases) page and download the latest .jar file

By default, this application will generate dot books from my high school's marching band show from 2018.
The show can be changed by going into the .jar archive and changing the `coordinates.csv` file to the coordinates of the desired show,
or by modifying the [coordinates.csv](src/main/java/resources/coordinates.csv) file in the source folder and then rebuilding the project.

Double-click the executable .jar file. The following window should appear:
<div algin="center">
<img alt="app-interface" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85715371/157697099-a0a77597-68d2-4a4f-8f21-96e4da3ab79c.png">
</div>

The window accepts the following inputs:
- __Performer ID__: The ID of the performer, which can be any value in the first column of [coordinates.csv](src/main/java/resources/coordinates.csv)
- __Sets__: The range of sets (inclusive) to generate dot book pages for. The pre-loaded show goes from sets 1 to 60.

Pressing __Submit__ will generate the files.

### Output
The app should create a folder named `dotbook_output` in the same directory as the .jar that you executed. This folder contains the following:
- PDF files containing full dot books, with each set on its own page. They are named `Dotbook_<Performer ID>_<Begin Set>-<End Set>.pdf`
- There should also be a folder called `individial_sets`. This contains each individual set as a separate PDF file.
They are named `db_<Performer ID>_<Set>.pdf`

The following is a sample page generated by the program:

</div>

You can view more sample output files [here](sample%20output).

### Features
- Copies every piece of information from the coordinate sheet, such as the song, performer ID, set number, measure counts, move type, and field position.
- Displays the performer's location as a large black dot, relative to the 4 nearest yard line markers and the nearest hash marks or sideline.
- Displays all other performers in a 15 yard by 15 yard box around the performer. All performers within a 5 yard radius of the performer are guaranteed to be shown.
- Shows the direction of movement from the previous set to the current set (if applicable), and the direction of movement from the current set to the next set (if applicable)

## Building
* Clone this repo or download as a .zip file
* Open it in your preferred IDE (I used NetBeans) and build it with dependencies
